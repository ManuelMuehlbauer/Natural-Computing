      When given a particle, fitness() applies its coordinates
      to the problem and returns a fitness value.
      The functions here are standard problems in evolutionary computation.
      I took them from the paper "Dynamic Sociometry in Particle Swarm Optimization"
      from Richards and Ventura (you can also see pictures of them,
      of course only two-dimensional )
